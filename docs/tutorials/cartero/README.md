# Introduction

Let's build something!

In this tutorial, you'll go through the steps of creating a **mail service** called **Cartero**. Users will be able to send emails and access their email history.

It will consist in two parts:

- A REST API that allows clients to send emails.
- A management site that lets you see the history of sent emails.

This tutorial makes a few assumptions:

- You have a basic working knowledge of Python.
- You already have Bocadillo installed (see [Installation] if needed).
- You have a feeling for what Python asynchronous programming is. If that is not the case, we recommend you read our [introduction] and our [Async vs Sync] discussion first.

The code for this tutorial is available at [the Cartero repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bocadillo/cartero). Check it out to evaluate your progress towards the final product!
